# Save and recall Memory

Memory keeps durable decisions, constraints, and facts. PreparedContext selects relevant history for one request;
it is temporary and does not create another Memory entry.

## Save, recall, and correct

1. Complete the [Quick Start](../get-started/quickstart.md) and keep the resolved Scope consistent across sessions.
2. Explicitly ask the Agent to save the information. A direct `remember_memory` write does not require a model.
3. Search with `search_memory`, or inspect entries with `list_memory_entries` and `get_memory_entry` where the host
   exposes them. Keep the returned citation when referring to a result.
4. Use the current citation to revise incorrect information or retire information that should no longer be recalled.
   Retirement removes it from active recall while preserving history.

Host tool names differ; see [Connect Agents](../integrations/index.md). The
[HTTP API](../develop/http-api.md) exposes the complete request schemas and concurrency requirements.

## Automatic context and extraction

Recall hooks ask the Server for bounded PreparedContext. An `empty` result is valid when no relevant information is
available. Returned history does not override current instructions or live project state.

Capturing a prompt creates Source evidence. It does not guarantee Memory extraction. Enable a generation model and
Source processing through [model configuration](../get-started/configure-models.md); configure embeddings only
when [vector or hybrid search](configure-vector-search.md) is needed. Review the host's prompt-capture switch before
recording project input.

Topic Memory has separate processing and retrieval surfaces (`search_topic_memory` and `get_topic_memory` on MCP).
It is not enabled by a basic explicit Memory write; inspect the Topic Memory settings and enabled runtime capabilities
in [Configuration](../operate/configuration.md).

Use [Handoff](memory-and-handoff.md) to transfer the current task boundary, and [Sources](sources.md) to preserve raw evidence.
