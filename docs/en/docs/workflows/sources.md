# Sources and capture

Sources preserve evidence before it becomes selected knowledge. A Content Source stores captured text; other Source
types can refer to material supplied by a connector. Work Contracts and Task Outcomes also preserve Source evidence.

## Capture and inspect

1. Choose an existing Scope. The [API Quick Start](../develop/api-quickstart.md) demonstrates content capture through
   `POST /v1/sources/content` and retains the returned Source reference.
2. Use `GET /v1/scopes/{scope_id}/sources` to browse the Source journal, then
   `GET /v1/scopes/{scope_id}/sources/{source_type}/{source_id}` to read the selected Source.
3. To process eligible evidence into Memory, configure a generation model and either scheduled processing or an
   explicit Memory flush. See [Enable extraction and vector search](../get-started/configure-models.md).

A successful capture means evidence was stored; it does not mean extraction succeeded or that the result was worth
keeping. Use Source references to trace a generated result back to its input. Do not retry a capture with changed
content under the same identity as if it were a new observation.

## Choose a capture path

- Agent prompt hooks: use the host-specific capture switch in [Connect Agents](../integrations/index.md).
- Files and object stores: use the [OpenDAL connector](ingest-text-files-with-opendal.md).
- Subject evidence for a Scope profile: follow [Scope profiles](use-profiles.md).
- Application or evaluation events: use the application's adapter; [Bub capture](../integrations/evaluation.md) is opt-in.

Source writes and reads are subject to the selected [Scope and access policy](scopes-and-access.md).
